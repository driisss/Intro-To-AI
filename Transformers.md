Transformers Overview

Transformers are deep learning models designed to handle sequential data with greater efficiency than RNNs. They use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, which improves training speed and captures long-range dependencies effectively.

The Transformer architecture includes an encoder and a decoder, both built with attention layers and feed-forward networks. It has become the foundation for state-of-the-art models in NLP like BERT, GPT, and T5.
