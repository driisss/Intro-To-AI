Loss Functions

Loss functions quantify the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual target value. This feedback signal is used to adjust the weights of the network during training. For regression tasks, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used, while classification tasks often use Cross-Entropy Loss.

The goal of training is to minimize the loss function, which means improving the modelâ€™s predictions. A smaller loss indicates better performance. Understanding how different loss functions behave helps in choosing the right one for your specific task.
