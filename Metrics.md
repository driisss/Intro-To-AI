Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics help assess a model's performance beyond just accuracy. For classification, metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix provide insights into different types of errors.

For regression tasks, metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared are used. Choosing the right metric depends on the problem's context and what types of errors are most costly or important to detect.
