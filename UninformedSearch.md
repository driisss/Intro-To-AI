Uninformed Search (Blind Search)
    Definition:
Uninformed search algorithms do not have any domain-specific knowledge about the
problem other than the definition of the initial state, possible actions, and goal test.
They explore blindly without knowing whether they're moving closer to the goal.
    Examples:
•Breadth-First Search (BFS) – explores level by level.
•Depth-First Search (DFS) – explores as deep as possible.
