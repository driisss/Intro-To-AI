Perceptron & Neural Networks

The perceptron, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt, is the most basic neural network model that attempts to mimic a single neuron. It makes decisions by weighing input features and applying an activation function to determine the output. While useful conceptually, the perceptron is limited in its ability to solve non-linear problems.

Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) expand on the perceptron by stacking multiple layers of neurons, enabling the network to learn more abstract patterns. MLPs are capable of solving complex classification and regression tasks and serve as the core of many deep learning systems.
