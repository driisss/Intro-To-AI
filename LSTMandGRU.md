LSTM & GRU

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks address the shortcomings of basic RNNs by using special structures called gates to control the flow of information. These gates help the model remember relevant information over longer sequences and forget irrelevant parts.

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a simplified version of LSTMs that achieve similar performance with fewer parameters. Both are widely used in natural language processing, time series forecasting, and other sequential data tasks where memory is crucial.
