Final Project & Wrap-Up

To bring everything together, build a small end-to-end deep learning project. Choose a domain you're interested inâ€”such as image classification, sentiment analysis, or time series prediction.

This project should include data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment steps. Reflect on what you've learned, document your process, and optionally publish it on GitHub or a blog to showcase your skills.
