# üß† Deep Learning (DL) Notes

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning involving neural networks with many layers, enabling learning of complex patterns.

---

## Key Concepts
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ‚Äî great for images
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) ‚Äî good for sequential data
- Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Backpropagation & Gradient Descent

---

## Popular Architectures
- AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet (for images)
- LSTM, GRU (for sequences)
- Transformers (for NLP)

---

## Applications
- Speech recognition
- Image and video analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Autonomous vehicles
