Build a CNN

To build a CNN, you'll define convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and dense layers for classification. You'll often use frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras, which provide easy APIs for model building.

Start with a simple dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10 to practice. Youâ€™ll learn how hyperparameters like kernel size, stride, and number of filters influence performance. Visualizing learned filters and feature maps helps deepen understanding of what the model is learning.
