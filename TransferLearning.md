Transfer Learning

Transfer learning leverages a pre-trained model—trained on a large dataset like ImageNet—and adapts it to a new but related task. This approach significantly reduces training time and often yields better results, especially when the new dataset is small.

There are two main approaches: using the pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor or fine-tuning it by unfreezing some layers and retraining them. Models like VGG, ResNet, and Inception are widely used in transfer learning applications.
