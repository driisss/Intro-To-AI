Model Deployment

Deployment involves making your trained model available for use in real-world applications. This includes saving the model, integrating it into a software system, and providing an API or interface for predictions.

Tools like Flask, FastAPI, and TensorFlow Serving help in deploying models as web services. Deployment also includes monitoring model performance in production and updating it when necessary.
