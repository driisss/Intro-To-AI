# üéÆ Reinforcement Learning (RL) Notes

## What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning where agents learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

---

## Core Concepts
- Agent, Environment, Actions, States, Rewards
- Policy: Strategy that the agent follows
- Value Function: Expected reward
- Exploration vs Exploitation

---

## Popular Algorithms
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods

---

## Applications
- Game playing (Chess, Go, Atari games)
- Robotics
- Autonomous driving
- Resource management
