Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your training data without collecting new data. It involves applying random transformations such as rotations, flips, zooms, and shifts to the original dataset, effectively increasing its size.

Augmentation helps the model generalize better by exposing it to varied versions of the same data. This reduces overfitting and makes the network more robust. Libraries like Keras provide simple functions to apply data augmentation in real-time during training.
