RNNs Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data like time series, audio, and text. They have a looped architecture that allows information to persist across time steps, making them suitable for tasks where context matters.

However, standard RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradients. They often fail to retain information from earlier steps in long sequences. This limitation led to the development of more advanced RNN variants like LSTM and GRU.
