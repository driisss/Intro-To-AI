CNNs Basics

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that excel in image processing tasks. They work by using filters (kernels) to scan through the input image, extracting spatial features like edges, textures, and patterns at different levels of abstraction.

CNNs include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the data, speeding up computation and helping to avoid overfitting. CNNs are fundamental to tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
