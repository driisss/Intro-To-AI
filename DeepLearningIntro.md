Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to identify and learn complex patterns from large volumes of data. It is the driving force behind many modern technological advancements such as facial recognition, language translation, and self-driving cars. Deep Learning excels particularly in tasks that involve unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.

It differs from traditional Machine Learning by its ability to automatically discover feature representations from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. Understanding its key components—like neurons, layers, weights, and activation functions—sets a strong foundation for building and interpreting models effectively.
