Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters are configurations set before training, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers. Tuning them can significantly impact model performance. Methods like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are commonly used.

Automated tools like Optuna and Ray Tune make this process easier. Understanding which hyperparameters to tune and how they interact helps in building efficient and high-performing models.
