Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms that rely heavily on feature engineering, deep learning models automatically discover relevant features through hierarchical layers, enabling them to process raw data like images, text, and sound more effectively. This layered structure allows deep learning to excel in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis.

At the core of deep learning are neural networks composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons" organized in layers: input, hidden, and output layers. Data passes through these layers where each neuron applies a transformation based on learned weights and activation functions, enabling the network to capture intricate relationships in data. Training these networks involves adjusting the weights through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent, allowing the model to minimize errors and improve its performance on specific tasks.
