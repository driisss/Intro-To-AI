Machine Learning
• Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers
so they can learn from data.
• General Definition: [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives
computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.—
Arthur Samuel, 1959
• More engineering-oriented definition: A computer program is said to
learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some
performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P,
improves with experience E.—Tom Mitchell, 1997
