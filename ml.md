# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning (ML) Notes

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)
- **Semi-supervised Learning**: Combination of labeled and unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through rewards and penalties

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering

## Applications
- Spam detection
- Image recognition
- Fraud detection
- Recommendation systems
