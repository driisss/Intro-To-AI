First Neural Network

With the foundational knowledge in place, it's time to implement a simple neural network. Using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you can build a model to classify digits in the MNIST dataset. This involves data preprocessing, model building, compilation, training, and evaluation.

Throughout this process, you'll learn practical concepts like setting input dimensions, selecting appropriate layers, choosing activation and loss functions, and visualizing model performance. This hands-on experience is essential to reinforce your theoretical understanding.
