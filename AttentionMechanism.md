Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when making predictions. This is especially useful in tasks like machine translation, where each word in the output may depend on specific parts of the input.

Attention calculates weights for each input element, emphasizing the most relevant parts during decoding. It improves model interpretability and performance, especially in long sequences. Attention is a core building block in modern architectures like Transformers.
