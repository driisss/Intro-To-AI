Build a Text Classifier

To solidify understanding of NLP concepts, you'll build a simple text classifier using embeddings and either RNNs or Transformers. Datasets like IMDb reviews or news categorization are suitable for practice.

You'll go through preprocessing steps like tokenization, padding, and encoding. Training such a model teaches essential NLP pipeline skills and gives hands-on experience with embeddings and sequence modeling.
