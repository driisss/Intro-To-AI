Machine Learning is Great for:
• Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists
of rules (a machine learning model can often simplify code and perform better
than the traditional approach)
• Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good
solution (the best machine learning techniques can perhaps find a solution)
• Fluctuating environments (a machine learning system can easily be retrained
on new data, always keeping it up to date)
• Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data
