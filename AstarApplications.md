A star (A*) Algorithm

How it Works:
1.Start from the initial node.
2.Explore the node with the lowest f(n) value.
3.Update neighboring nodes with new path costs.
4.Repeat until the goal node is reached.
Applications:
•Pathfinding in maps and games
•Robot motion planning
•Puzzle-solving (e.g., 8-puzzle, sliding tiles)
