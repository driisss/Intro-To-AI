Breadth First Search (uninformed)
• Root node is expanded first
• Then all the successors of
the root node are expanded
Then their successors are
expanded and so on.
• Nodes, which are visited
first will be expanded first
(FIFO)
• All the nodes of depth ‘d’
are expanded before
expanding any node of
depth ‘d+1’
